# Strict Host Key Checking
# In host key checking, ssh automatically maintains and checks a database containing identification for all hosts it has ever been used with. Host keys 
# are stored in ~/.ssh/known_hosts in the user's home directory. Additionally, the /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts file is automatically checked for known hosts. 
# Any new hosts can be automatically added to the user's file. If a host's identification changes, ssh warns about this and disables password 
# authentication to prevent server spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks, which could otherwise be used to circumvent the encryption. 

# As long as strict host key checking is enabled, the SSH client connects only to SSH hosts listed in the known host list. It rejects all other SSH hosts

# The ssh_config keyword "StrictHostKeyChecking" can be used to control logins to machines whose host key is not known or has changed
# to disable it while running ssh command
ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no yourHardenedHost.com

# to do it ~/.ssh/config to make it permenant
Host *

firmware is the software on your hardware which runs it, its the lowest level software running on the hardware
BIOS was the old firmware of the computer hardware
UEFI the new version of firmware for computers, installed /boot folder in linux

/sys is the folder with all the operating system related stuff
            block  bus  class  dev  devices  firmware  fs  hypervisor  kernel  module  power
block => has all the hard drives
/sys/bus/cpu/devices => here you can see all the CPUs available to the OS

/dev contains all devices related folder, all added devices are visible here

/proc this directory contains info related to processes of the machine, the numbers in this folders are the processes being run

$ lsusb => how many usb devices are attached to this machine

$ lspci => what hardware devices (cpu, isa bridge, vga graphics card,..) are attached to this machine

$ lsblock => the hdd,sdd and ram that are attached to this device

$ lshw => shows all hardware and firmwares on this machine

when linux machine is booting up, you can see all the logs related to kernel booting up

$dmesg  => shows all the logs related to system booting up, they are located at /var/log/dmesg

each hard drive is divided to partitions, in linux devices are defined at /dev , /dev/sda1 , /dev/sda2 ,... 
the sda1 and sda2 partitions are mounted at /dev folder at /sda and /sdb folders.  
$ fdisk /dev/sda => this command will open sda hard disk in fdisk software to change or view partitions

$ sudo mount | grep sda  => shows all partitions for sda disk

LVM => Logical Volume Management, is used for cases when you need to resize the partitions.
via LVM you can add up several physical drives to one bigger virtual drive (Volume Group) that itself can be partitioned.

you have to put around 1GB of hard disk aside for the /boot folder, where kernel is located at.

partition design for server machine:

total : 1TB
swap: ram+2gb | /boot 1gb | /var 30 gb for server logs | /home 900gb | /usr 20 gb

$ jobs => shows all paused processes

Ctrl+C => aborts the current foreground process
Ctrl+Z => pauses/stops current foreground process, it can be resumed later

if a parent process dies, all the child processes die with it too.

nohup => allows your child process to live, even when parent process dies.

the process below wont die even when you close the shell:
$ nohup ping 4.4.5.1  => appending output to nohup.out

$ nohup script.sh > mynohup.out 2>&1 &

    nohup script.sh => run this script with nohup (don't kill it when we close the shell)
    > mynohup.out => put the output in the mynohup.out file
    2>&1 => also put the errors in mynohup.out file
    & => run it in the background


$ kill -1 PROCESS_ID  => HUP tell the process that the shell that is controlling it is dead
$ kill -15 PROCESS_ID => TERM ask process to terminate (this is default signal)
$ kill -9 PROCESS_ID  => KILL forcefully kills the process

$ pkill pyt => kill all processes that contain the word "pyt" in their name

$ ps => PID TTY TIME CMD
    PID => ID of the process
    TTY => from which terminal its running
    TIME => how much time it borrows from the cpu
    CMd => with what command it started running

$ ps -e => shows all processes currently running on this machine
$ ps -e | wc -l

$ pgrep calc | xargs kill => find all processes that contain the word "calc", then kill them all

$ top => shows all the processes, sorts them based on cpu usage, press "q" to quit top

$ free => shows total memory, used and free and total SWAP used and free

$ uptime => how long the system has been up (not restarted) : 16:12  up 16 days,  2:45, 2 users, load averages: 2.23 2.19 2.11

$ watch COMMAND
$ watch df -h => run this command every 2 seconds and show the new result
$ watch df -h | grep sda

** link in linux is similar to shortcut on windows OS
softLink => only points to the original file like shortcut, will not work if the main file is deleted,  it changes when you edit the original file

hardLink => is a full copy of the file, still works if you delete the original, it changes when you edit the original file.

$ ln myfile hard_link => creates a hard link named hard_link
$ ls -i => you can see both original and hard link point to same inode
$ unlink hard_link => delete the link 

$ ln -s myfile soft_link => creates a soft link
$ unlink soft_link

** softLink is much more common than hardLink

$ find / -type l => find all links in the whole system

as we can see when we run the command python3, it is a soft link to python3.10
$ which python3
    /Applications/miniconda3/bin/python3
$ ls -l /Applications/miniconda3/bin/python3
    lrwxr-xr-x  1 babakhabibnejad  staff  10 Mar 24 16:55 /Applications/miniconda3/bin/python3 -> python3.10

$ echo $PATH => this variable contains all locations that shell commands are saved at.
    /Applications/miniconda3/bin:/Applications/miniconda3/condabin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/System/Cryptexes/App/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/new/dir => add a new directory to the PATH variable

$ which ping => this command shows where the command "ping" is saved at : /sbin/ping

$ find /etc -iname "*vmware*" => find all files and directories that contain "vmware" in their name, -iname is case insensitive

$ locate aws => find files that contain "aws" in their name, its faster than find, but is based on databse that is updated once per day

** the shell setting are usaually located at "/etc/profile" and at "/home/USERNAME/.bashrc"

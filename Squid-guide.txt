Squid Proxy

proxy is a middle man that processes outgoing requests on your behalf.
there are two types of proxy:
HTTP Proxy
Socket Secure Proxy (SOCKS)


Https proxy benefits:
    - anonymity
    - access region locked content
    - monitor web traffic
    - can block content on proxy's config
    - won't expose client metadata to the server


1. Install squid
sudo apt install squid

2. Make copy of squid.conf 
sudo cp /etc/squid/squid.conf /etc/squid/squid.conf.default

3. Edit squid.conf 
sudo code /etc/squid/squid.conf, uncomment "http_access allow localnet", save file

4. Restart Squid 
sudo systemctl restart squid

5. Check if its running 
sudo systemctl status squid => Should see "running" and "active"

6. Configure Proxy in Postman and test (Settings, then Proxy tab). Add IP of Proxy Server, then default port (3128)

7. Check Access log for entries
sudo code /var/log/squid/access.log

8. Add basic user / password for authentication
# add these lines to the acl section of "squid.conf" file
        auth_param basic program /usr/lib/squid/basic_ncsa_auth /etc/squid/htpasswd
        auth_param basic realm Squid Proxy Caching Web Server
        acl authenticated proxy_auth REQUIRED
        acl authenticated_ips src {{CLIENT_IP_ADDRESS}}/32
# replace http_access allow localnet" with the code line below:
        http_access allow authenticated authenticated_ips

9. Run the following replacing “username” and “password” accordingly, they will be saved in this file => /etc/squid/htpasswd
sudo printf "USERNAME:$(openssl passwd PASSWORD)\n" | sudo tee -a /etc/squid/htpasswd

10. Restart Squid
sudo systemctl restart squid

11. Configure Postman to use Proxy Auth (Settings then Proxy). Fill in Username and Password, then repeat the step 6
